Max and Maurice

A Story of Two Boys

in Seven Pranks

(1865)


Preface

Ah, how often we must hear or read
Of wicked children's naughty deeds!!
Like, for example, these two here,
Whose names were Max and Maurice dear;

Who, instead of with wise lessons
Turning themselves to what is good,
Often laughed about it all
And secretly made fun of it. —
— Yes, to mischief-making,

Yes, for that one is prepared! —
— Teasing people, tormenting animals,
Stealing apples, pears, and plums — —
That is, of course, more pleasant
And also much more convenient,

Than in church or in the school
To sit still upon a stool. —
— But woe, oh woe, oh woe!
When I look upon the end!! —
— Ah, that was a wicked thing,

How it went for Max and Maurice.
— Therefore, what they did
Is drawn and written down here.

First Prank


Many a person takes great pains
With the dear poultry;
Partly for the sake of eggs,
Which these birds do lay,

Secondly, because now and then
One can eat a roast;
Thirdly, however, one also takes
Their feathers for use
In the pillows and the bolsters,

For one does not like to lie cool. —


Look, there is the widow Bolte,
Who also did not want that.


Her chickens were three
And a proud rooster besides. —


Max and Maurice now thought:
What is to be done here now? —
— Very quickly, one, two, three,
They cut some bread in two,


Into four parts, each piece

As thick as a little finger.
These they tie to threads,
Criss-cross, a piece to each,
And lay them out, precisely
In the yard of the good woman. —


Hardly has the rooster seen this,
He already begins to crow:
Cock-a-doodle-doo! Cock-a-doodle-doo!! —
Cluck cluck cluck! — there they come.


Rooster and hens swallow cheerfully

Each a piece of bread down;


But when they come to their senses,
None could really get away.


Criss-cross and to and fro
They pull each other back and forth,


Flutter up and into the air,
Oh dear, oh deary me!


Oh, they get stuck on the long
Dry branch of the tree. —
— And their necks grow long and longer,
Their song grows faint and fainter;


Each one quickly lays an egg,

And then death comes along. —


Widow Bolte, in her chamber,
Hears this lament in her bed;


Full of foreboding, she steps out:
Oh, what a horror that was!


"Flow from my eyes, you tears!

All my hopes, all my longing,
My life's most beautiful dream
Hangs on this apple tree!!"


Deeply grieved and full of sorrow
She now gets the knife;
Takes the dead from the strings,
So they no longer hang like that,


And with a silent, mournful gaze
She returns to her house. —


This was the first prank,
But the second follows right away.


Second Prank


When the good widow Bolte
Recovered from her grief,
She thought this way and that,
That it would be for the best,

The deceased, who here below
Departed so very early,
Quite silently and with honor
To consume well-roasted. —
— Of course, the grief was great,

When they now so naked and bare
Lay plucked by the hearth,
They, who once in fine days
Sometimes in the yard, sometimes in the garden
Happily scratched in the sand. -


Oh, Mrs. Bolte weeps anew,
And Spitz the dog stands by as well.

Max and Maurice smelled this;
"Quick, up to the roof!" was the word.


Through the chimney with delight

They see the chickens lying,
Which already without head and throat
Are sizzling sweetly in the pan. —


Just then, with a plate,

Widow Bolte goes to the cellar,


To get herself a portion
Of the sauerkraut,
For which she has a special fondness,

When it is warmed up again. — —
Meanwhile on the roof
They are busy with the matter.
Max has already with forethought
Brought a fishing rod along. —


Snip-snap! up it goes,
A chicken is already lifted up.
Snip-snap! now number two;
Snip-snap! now number three;

And now comes number four:
Snip-snap! we have you!! —
— Spitz the dog saw it clearly, though,
And he barks: Woof! Woof!


But they are already quite cheerful

Gone and down from the roof. —

— Well! That will cause a spectacle,
For Mrs. Bolte is just arriving;
Rooted to the spot she stood,
When she looked at the pan.


All the chickens were gone -
"Spitz!!" - that was her first word. —


"Oh, you Spitz, you monster!! —
But wait! I'll get him!!!"


With the spoon, large and heavy,
She goes after Spitz;
Loudly his cry of pain resounds,
For he feels himself innocent. —


— Max and Maurice, in their hiding place,
Are snoring by the hedge,
And of the whole chicken feast
Only one leg is peeking out. —


This was the second prank,
But the third follows right away.


Third Prank


Everyone in the village knew
One who was named Böck. —


— Everyday coats, Sunday coats,
Long trousers, pointed tailcoats,

Vests with convenient pockets,
Warm coats and gaiters —
All these items of clothing
Tailor Böck knew how to make. —
— Or if there was something to mend,

To cut off, to piece on,
Or even a button on the trousers
Torn off or loose —
How and where and whatever it may be,
Back, front, all the same —

Master Böck does everything,
For that is his life's purpose. —
— That is why in the community
Everyone likes him as a friend. —
— But Max and Maurice thought,

How they could annoy him. —


Namely, in front of the master's house
A stream flowed with a rush.
Over the water leads a footbridge
And over it goes the path. —


Max and Maurice, not at all lazy,
Secretly saw with the saw,
Ritsch-ratsch! full of malice,
Into the bridge a gap. —

When this deed is done,

Suddenly a cry is heard:


"Hey, come out! you billy-goat!
Tailor, tailor, baa, baa, baa!!" —
— Böck could endure anything,
Without saying a single word;

But when he heard this,
It went against his nature. —


Quickly, he jumps with his yardstick
Over the threshold of his house,
For already to his fright

A loud "Baa, baa, baa!!" resounds.


And already he is on the bridge,
Crack! The bridge breaks into pieces;


Again it sounds: "Baa, baa, baa!"
Plump! there goes the tailor!


Just as this happened,
A pair of geese comes swimming by,
Which Böck in mortal fear
Clutches tightly by the legs.


Both geese in his hand,

He flutters onto dry land. —


By the way, for all that,
Something like this is not comfortable;


As Böck from the story
Also got a stomach ache.


Highly to be praised here is Mrs. Böck!
For a hot iron,
Brought onto the cold body,
Has made it all right again. —


— Soon up and down the village,
The word was: Böck is cheerful again!! —
This was the third prank,
But the fourth follows right away.


Fourth Prank


Thus reads a resolution:
That man must learn something. —
— Not just the A-B-C
Brings a person up in the world;

Not just in writing, reading
Does a reasonable being practice;
Not just in matters of arithmetic
Should a person make an effort;
But also the teachings of wisdom

One must hear with pleasure. —


That this was done with understanding,
Mr. Teacher Lämpel was there. —

— Max and Maurice, these two,
Did not like him for that reason;

For whoever plays wicked pranks,
Pays no attention to the teacher. —

Now this good teacher
Was an admirer of tobacco,
Which one without any question

After the day's toil and trouble
To a good, old man
Can also grant from the heart. —


Max and Maurice, undeterred,
Are already plotting pranks,

Whether by means of his pipe
This man could not be attacked. —
— One day, when it was Sunday again
And Mr. Lämpel, good and honest,
In the church with feeling
Sat before his organ playing,


The wicked boys sneaked
Into his house and his rooms,
Where the meerschaum pipe stood;
Max holds it in his hand;


But Maurice from his pocket

Pulls out the gunpowder flask,
And quickly, stuff, stuff, stuff!
Powder into the pipe bowl. -
Now just be quiet and quick, home,
For church is already over. -


Just then, in gentle peace,
Lämpel closes his church;
And with book and music sheets,

After his official duties,
He joyfully directs his steps
To his native cottage,


And full of gratitude then,
He lights his little pipe.


"Ah!" - he says - "the greatest joy
Is, after all, contentment!!!"


Boom!! - the pipe goes off
With a terrible, great noise.
Coffee pot and water glass,

Tobacco box, inkwell,
Stove, table, and seat of sorrows -
Everything flies in the powder flash. -


When the smoke now cleared,
One sees Lämpel, who, thank God!

Lies alive on his back;
But he has gotten something.
Nose, hand, face, and ears
Are as black as the Moors,
And the last tuft of his hair
Is burned off to his head. —


Who shall now teach the children
And increase knowledge?
Who shall now for Lämpel conduct

His official duties?
From what shall the teacher smoke,
When the pipe is not usable??

With time, all will be healed,
Only the pipe has had its share. —


This was the fourth prank,
But the fifth follows right away.


Fifth Prank


Whoever in village or town
Has an uncle living,
Should be polite and modest,
For the uncle likes that. —

— In the morning one says: "Good morning!
Do you have any errands?"
Brings him what he must have:
Newspaper, pipe, pipe lighter. —
Or should it somewhere in the back

Press, bite, or tweak,
One is immediately with joy
Obliging and ready. —
Or be it after a pinch of snuff,
That the uncle sneezes violently,

One calls out "Bless you!" at once,
"Thank you! May it do you good!!" —
Or if he comes home late,
One pulls off his boots,
Fetches slippers, dressing gown, cap,

So that he does not sit in the cold -
In short, one is mindful of
What brings the uncle joy. —

— Max and Maurice, for their part,
Found no appeal in this. —

Just imagine what a bad joke
They played on Uncle Fritz! —


Everyone knows what a May-
bug is as a creature. —
In the trees back and forth

It flies and creeps and crawls.


Max and Maurice, always cheerful,
Shake them down from the tree.


Into a paper bag
They lock up the crawling creatures. —


Away with it, and into the corner
Under Uncle Fritz's blanket!!


Soon to bed goes Uncle Fritz
In his pointed nightcap;


His eyes he closes,

Wraps himself up and sleeps in peace.


But the bugs, scritch scratch!
Quickly come out of the mattress.


Already one, the one in front,
Grabs Uncle Fritz's nose.


"Wow!!" - he screams - "What is this?!!"
And seizes the critter.


And the uncle, full of horror,
Is seen rushing out of bed.


"Ouch!!" - He's got another one

On his neck, on his legs;


Back and forth and all around
It crawls, it flies with a buzz.


Uncle Fritz, in this distress,
Hits and tramples everything to death.


Look at that! Now it's over
With the bug-crawling!!


Uncle Fritz has peace again
And closes his eyes. —
This was the fifth prank,
But the sixth follows right away.


Sixth Prank


In the beautiful Easter time,
When the pious bakers,
Many sweet sugary things
Bake and prepare,
Max and Maurice also wished
For something like that for their use. —


But the baker, with deliberation,

Has locked the bakehouse.


So, if someone wants to steal here,
He must torment himself through the chimney. —


Crash!! — There come the two boys
Through the chimney, black as ravens.


Poof!! — They fall into the chest,
Where the flour is inside.


There! Now they are both
All around as white as chalk.


But already with much pleasure

They see the pretzels lying.


Crack!! - The chair breaks in two;


Splash!! - There they lie in the dough.


Completely covered in cake batter
They stand there as a picture of misery. —


Immediately the master baker appears
And notices the sweet-tooths.


One, two, three! - Before you know it,
Two loaves of bread are made from them.


In the oven it still glows -

Shove!! - into the oven hole with them!


Shove!! - they are pulled from the heat —
For now they are brown and good. —


Everyone thinks: "They are done for!"
But no! - they are still alive! —


Crunch, crunch! - like two mice
They eat through the casing;


And the master baker cried:
"Oh dear! There they run!!" —
This was the sixth prank,
But the last one follows right away.


Final Prank


Max and Maurice, woe to you!
Now comes your final prank! —
Why must the two of them
Cut holes in the sacks?? —


Look, there farmer Mecke carries
One of his malt sacks. —


But hardly is he away,
The grain already begins to spill.


And astonished he stands and says:
"Zounds! That thing is getting lighter!"


Hey! There he sees with joy

Max and Maurice in the grain.


Grab!! - into his big sack
He shovels the scamps.


Max and Maurice are getting dizzy,
For now it's off to the mill. —


"Master Miller, hey, come here!
Grind this as fast as you can!"


"Bring it here!" — And into the hopper
He shakes the villains. —


Rickeracke! Rickeracke!

Goes the mill with a cracking sound.


Here one can still see them
Finely ground and in pieces.


But immediately they are consumed by
Master Miller's poultry. —


Conclusion


When this was learned in the village,
There was no trace of sadness. —
— Widow Bolte, mild and soft,
Said: "See there, I thought so at once!" —

— Yes yes yes! cried Master Böck —
"Wickedness is not a purpose in life!" —
— Thereupon Mr. Teacher Lämpel spoke:
"This is another example!" —
— "Of course!" thinks the confectioner,

"Why are people so fond of sweets?!" —
— Even good Uncle Fritz
Said: "That comes from stupid jokes!" —
— But the good farmer
Thought: "What's that to me?!" —

— In short, all around the village
Went a joyful hum:
"Thank God! Now it's over
With the mischief-making!!"
