## From Zero to Hero: How to put GPT LLMs & friends into your applications - Generative AI in Action

Unlocking the power of human language as the universal interface for software solutions—sounds intriguing, right? In this masterclass, Christian and Sebastian dive into integrating Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) into your applications. With a focus on Python APIs, we’ll guide you in leveraging the capabilities of both OpenAI GPT and open-source models across a variety of use cases.
The course centers on key architectural patterns such as In-Context Learning, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Structured Output, Tool Calling, and Reasoning & Acting (ReAct). These techniques are essential for building cutting-edge, AI-enhanced business applications.
Let’s explore practical approaches and end-to-end methods for integrating Generative AI into your business applications.

Topics Covered:
- Human language as an interface for software solutions: Prompts as the universal UI
- Generative AI with Large Language Models: Use cases & basics with Python APIs
- Architectural patterns: In-Context Learning, RAG, Structured Output, Tool Calling, and Reasoning & Acting
- Python-based SDKs for advanced scenarios
- Integrating chat systems (e.g., Slack): Accessing your custom LLM-powered solutions
- Speech-to-text & text-to-speech: Bridging spoken language and your software with LLMs and back
- Real-world integration: End-to-end Generative AI examples from customer projects

Get ready for a pragmatic journey that equips you with essential skills and applied techniques using both proprietary and open-source LLMs.
